# NOISAI
NOISAI aims to transform the way we generate and consume energy - a groundbreaking solution. By harnessing the power of sound waves, NOISAI introduces a revolutionary technology that converts ambient noise into clean, renewable electricity. This innovative approach not only addresses the global energy crisis but also creates a decentralized, community-driven energy marketplace powered by blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI).

# The Vision
The world is facing an unprecedented energy challenge. With rising energy demands, depleting fossil fuels, and the urgent need to combat climate change, there is a growing demand for sustainable and scalable energy solutions. NOISAI envisions a future where energy is not only clean and renewable but also accessible to everyone, everywhere. By leveraging sound—a ubiquitous and underutilized resource—NOISAI is paving the way for a new era of energy innovation.
