# NOISAI
NOISAI aims to transform the way we generate and consume energy - a groundbreaking solution. By harnessing the power of sound waves, NOISAI introduces a revolutionary technology that converts ambient noise into clean, renewable electricity. This innovative approach not only addresses the global energy crisis but also creates a decentralized, community-driven energy marketplace powered by blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI).

# The Vision
The world is facing an unprecedented energy challenge. With rising energy demands, depleting fossil fuels, and the urgent need to combat climate change, there is a growing demand for sustainable and scalable energy solutions. NOISAI envisions a future where energy is not only clean and renewable but also accessible to everyone, everywhere. By leveraging sound—a ubiquitous and underutilized resource—NOISAI is paving the way for a new era of energy innovation.

# Context
One major cost for most venues and stadiums is the cost of energy from the electric grid. This issue is becoming particularly acute following the increasing price of electricity during and following 2022 [1].
As of December 2024, the cost of electricity on the national grid has been capped to £0.245/KWh [2]. Three of the eight Qatari World Cup stadiums used a maximum of between 30 to 45MWh of energy [3] in one 90-minute match. Whilst the energy price cap only applies to households, if these major stadiums had paid these energy prices the stadiums would pay between £7350 and £11025 per match, in reality a stadium or music venue may pay significantly more than this value as the energy price cap only applies to households.
This has led multiple venues and stadiums worldwide to investigate the use of renewable energy production to reduce their reliance on the grid and hence their energy costs [4]. One common form of local energy production is solar energy stored via battery banks. This method has been utilised in Johan Cruijff Arena in the Netherlands where 4200 solar panels and a 2.8MWh storage system has been implemented [5]. However, the local power generation from renewables by themselves may not cover 100% of energy costs, for example London Stadium predicts that solar power will only be able to cover 10 – 15% of energy costs [4]. Another method of reducing energy costs of venues and stadiums is to regenerate lost energy, to minimise net energy consumption. One available resource of energy regeneration is the production of energy from sound. A stadium or music venue may be considered a highly resource rich environment for energy harvesting.

# Solution
The solution proposed by NOISAI is a revolutionary energy generation system that converts ambient noise, such as the sound produced in stadiums and music venues, into clean, renewable electricity. This technology addresses the dual challenges of rising energy costs and the need for sustainable energy solutions, particularly in high-energy-consumption environments like stadiums and concert venues. Here’s how NOISAI’s solution works and its potential impact:

# Key Features of NOISAI’s Solution
## Sound-to-Energy Conversion Technology:

NOISAI harnesses sound waves, a ubiquitous and underutilized resource, to generate electricity. This is particularly effective in environments like stadiums, music venues, industrial places, airports and more where noise levels are consistently high during events.

The technology captures ambient noise and converts it into electrical energy using advanced piezoelectric, nano technology or electromagnetic systems.

# Decentralized Energy Marketplace:

NOISAI integrates blockchain technology to create a decentralized energy marketplace. This allows venues to generate, store, and trade excess energy locally, reducing reliance on the grid and lowering energy costs.

Blockchain ensures transparency and efficiency in energy transactions, enabling venues to monetize excess energy.

## AI-Driven Optimization:

Artificial intelligence (AI) is used to optimize energy generation and consumption. AI algorithms analyze energy usage patterns and adjust the system to maximize efficiency.

This ensures that energy is generated and utilized in the most cost-effective and sustainable manner.

Complementary to Existing Renewable Energy Systems:

NOISAI’s technology can be integrated with other renewable energy systems, such as solar panels, wind turbines or kinetic pavements and battery storage, to create a hybrid energy solution.

For example, while solar panels may only cover 10–15% of a stadium’s energy needs, NOISAI’s sound-to-energy conversion could significantly increase the proportion of locally generated renewable energy.
